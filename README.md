Text Memorizing tool.<br>
Part of the site https://super-teacher.com/vocabulary/<br>
This site is a learning tool used for memorizing texts.<br>
The site utilizes "Spaced Repetition" technology in which the student reviews pieces of text (vocabulary)  repeatedly. The time-lapse between reviews of a piece of text grows as the student remembers the text.<br>
The files here are sample codes of my work.<br>
